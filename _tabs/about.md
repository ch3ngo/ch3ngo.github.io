Hello! My name is **Diego Fidalgo** and I am from Spain

I am an offensive security professional specialized in adversary simulation. I enjoy exploring attacker mindsets, testing security measures, and finding creative ways to challenge systems (always trying to make things more complicated than needed huh)

My work is a mix of curiosity with discipline, keeping pace with the latest technologies, techniques, and all things related to technology. I actively research new methods, tools, and developments in offensive cybersecurity.

For me, red teaming is not just about attacking and pawning systems, it's about learning how attackers and defenders think, adapt, and improve. I also like to share knowledge, help others understand why and how to strengthen security in relevant ways.
